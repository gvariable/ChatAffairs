## Motivation

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee has attached great importance to the reform of the administrative approval system and innovation in government management, and has made a series of important deployments. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasized on multiple occasions the need to further promote streamlining administration and delegating power, deepen the reform of the administrative approval system, relax market access, innovate regulatory methods, minimize government intervention in micro-affairs, and further stimulate market vitality and social creativity. The elderly population is an important part of society, and their demand for government services is increasing. However, due to physical conditions and limitations in cognitive abilities, they face many difficulties in accessing government services. As the window for government services, the Government Service Center should actively explore convenient service systems for the elderly population and provide them with higher quality and more convenient services.

## Contributions

+ Using **LLM**, we integrate the administrative processes, required documents, and locations of administrative procedures in Hubei Province. This allows for interactive consultations on relevant administrative processes, making government services more convenient.
+ Using **Text2Speech and Speech2Text** technologies, we make the consultation process simpler and more approachable for special groups such as the elderly.
+ **Customized voice output function** that can simulate the voices of users' loved ones, making consulting services more caring.
