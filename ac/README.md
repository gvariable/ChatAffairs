# Audio Cloning

Audio Cloning is a powerful feature that allows people to clone the timbre of audio with minimal training data. It produces high-quality audio output and can be implemented on low-end systems, even enabling real-time voice transformation.

## Key Features

- **Timbre Cloning**: Audio Cloning enables the cloning of audio timbre with remarkable accuracy. It can generate audio that closely resembles the cloned timbre, providing outstanding results.

- **High-Quality Output**: The generated audio output maintains a high level of quality and fidelity, ensuring an exceptional listening experience for users.

- **Low Configuration Requirements**: Audio Cloning can be deployed on lower configuration systems such as PC, allowing wider accessibility without the need for expensive hardware.

- **Real-Time Voice Transformation**: With Audio Cloning, real-time voice transformation becomes a reality. It empowers developers to build applications that can transform voices in real-time, opening up a new realm of possibilities.

## Training Progress

1. **Clone The Repo**: Clone [RVC](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) repo and follow its instructions.

2. **Prepare Training Data**: Start by collecting high-quality audio data that represents the desired timbre you want to clone. Ideally, gather at least 10 minutes of audio samples with the desired timbre.

3. **Configure Parameters**: Set the necessary parameters for your training. You can adjust parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training iterations to suit your specific requirements. Experimenting with different values may be necessary to achieve the desired results.

## Sample

We collected audio data of UP [Luo Xiang](https://space.bilibili.com/517327498?spm_id_from=333.1007.tianma.1-2-2.click) from the Bilibili platform and trained our model using this data. The results of the inference are as follows:
